$\blacktriangleright$ \textbf{Exercises 2.5.\quad Solution.} 

(1). \begin{itemize}
\item advantage: can fit many different functional forms; low bias; usually predict more accurately
\item disadvantage: overfitting problem; sually hard to interpret; high variance
\end{itemize}

(2). If our goal is to predict more accurately, it will usually be best to choose a more flexible approach.

(3). If our goal is to make some inferences, we prefer choosing a less flexible approach because the relation between response and predictor is more explicit.

$\blacktriangleright$ \textbf{Exercises 2.6.\quad Solution.} 

(1). The essential difference between parametric and non-parametric approach is that, the parametric make an assumption of the form of $f$, which can reduce problem of estimating $f$ down to one of estimating a set of parameter, but non-parametric do not make explicit assumptions about the functional form of $f$.


(2). \begin{itemize}
\item advantage: it is easier to estimate parameter; the relation between response and predictor is more explicit; 
\item disadvantage: the model we choose will usually not match the true unknown form of $f$; sometimes need more assumption.
\end{itemize}

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
